## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies (see individual project requirements)
- Basic understanding of agentic AI concepts

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to a specific application directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the application-specific README for setup instructions
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Learning Resources

Each application includes:
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the agent architecture and implementation
- **Code Comments:** Inline documentation explaining key concepts
- **Examples:** Sample usage and configuration
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides for understanding and extending the code

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
