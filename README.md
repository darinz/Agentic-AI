# Agentic AI Systems

Welcome to **Agentic AI Systems** â€“ your collaborative hub for exploring, building, and sharing knowledge about agentic AI, autonomous agents, and multi-agent systems.

## What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that act as autonomous agents: they perceive their environment, set and pursue goals, make decisions, and take initiative with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional, reactive AI, agentic AI is proactive, adaptive, and capable of complex reasoning and collaboration.

## Key Topics

- **Agent Architectures:**  
  Explore the design of intelligent agents, including reactive, deliberative, hybrid, and learning-based models.

- **Multi-Agent Systems:**  
  Study how multiple agents interact, cooperate, or compete to solve distributed and complex problems.

- **Coordination & Communication:**  
  Techniques for negotiation, consensus-building, and emergent behavior in agent societies.

- **Learning & Adaptation:**  
  How agents learn from experience, adapt to dynamic environments, and improve over time.

- **Practical Applications:**  
  - Autonomous assistants for business, research, and productivity  
  - Multi-agent simulations for logistics, finance, and smart cities  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents that proactively seek and use information  
  - Healthcare: diagnosis, workflow automation, and patient engagement  
  - Enterprise: contact center automation, workflow orchestration, and decision support

- **Future Directions:**  
  Research on general agentic intelligence, open-ended learning, and large-scale agent societies.
