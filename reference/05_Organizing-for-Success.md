## Organizing for Success in Building Agentic Systems

The rise of foundation models has made agent experimentation easy—and that’s a double-edged sword. Uncoordinated proofs of concept (POCs) generate ideas but also create fragmentation and duplicated effort. Conversely, premature standardization can freeze innovation and lock you into brittle frameworks. The path to success is a staged approach that balances exploration with alignment.

### Phase 1: Encourage Exploration (0 → 1)

- Goal: Discover valuable use cases and technical patterns quickly.
- How:
  - Fund small, time-boxed POCs across teams; optimize for learning, not polish.
  - Allow architectural diversity (workflows, RAG, agents) to surface fit-for-purpose patterns.
  - Require lightweight write-ups: problem, approach, metrics, what worked/failed, next steps.
- Guardrails:
  - Security/data handling basics (no PII leakage, secrets management, access controls).
  - Record provenance for every experiment (model versions, prompts, tools used).

### Phase 2: Converge on Standards (1 → n)

- Goal: Scale what works without stifling innovation.
- How:
  - “One standard per large group”: Each major function (e.g., Support, Finance) adopts a reference stack—shared runtime, tool SDK, eval harness, observability—but allows exceptions with justification.
  - Establish shared artifacts: prompt libraries, tool catalogs with contracts, golden datasets, evaluation playbooks.
  - Create a paved road (reference templates, CI/CD, guardrails) that is easier than the alternative.
- Guardrails:
  - Model/provider abstraction to avoid lock-in; favor open interfaces (OpenAPI, JSON Schema).
  - Change management for prompts/tools (versioning, canaries, rollback plans).

### Operating Model and Roles

- Product + Domain Leads: Prioritize use cases, define success metrics, own outcomes.
- Platform Team: Owns the paved road—SDKs, infra, observability, safety, cost controls.
- Red Team / Risk: Adversarial testing, policy compliance, data governance.
- Community of Practice: Cross-team forum to share learnings, patterns, and pitfalls.

### Governance: Lightweight, Evidence-Driven

- Principles over mandates: Default-allow experimentation with clear do/don’t lists.
- Promotion criteria: To move from POC → pilot → production, require: eval results, safety checks, cost/latency budgets, rollback plans.
- Review cadence: Monthly portfolio review of active POCs and pilots; retire or merge duplicates.

### Knowledge Sharing: Make Learning a First-Class Asset

- Centralize artifacts: repos for prompts, tools, eval datasets, incident reports, and postmortems.
- Broadcast updates: short internal notes highlighting wins, failures, and reusable snippets.
- Tag and search: consistent taxonomy for use cases, models, tools, and domains.

### Vendor Strategy and Open Standards

- Prefer open standards (OpenAPI, JSON Schema) and portable runtimes to minimize lock-in.
- Keep an exit plan: track dependencies on vendor-specific features and maintain alternatives.
- Benchmark regularly: compare cost/latency/quality across providers with the same evals.

### Success Metrics

- Portfolio health: % POCs promoted, duplication reduced, time-to-pilot.
- Reliability and safety: incident rate, policy violations, successful fallback rate.
- Business impact: task success rate, cycle time reduction, cost per action.
- Efficiency: infra cost per successful action, developer lead time, MTTR for tool failures.

### Putting It Together

Organizing around agentic systems is iterative. Start wide to learn fast, then converge on a paved road that accelerates delivery without shutting down exploration. With open standards, shared artifacts, lightweight governance, and a clear operating model, organizations can turn scattered agent experiments into scalable, reliable, and transformative capabilities embedded in everyday operations.
